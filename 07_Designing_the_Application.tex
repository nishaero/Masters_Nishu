\chapter{Designing the Application}\label{ch:application_design}
This chapter delves into the design objectives of the application, the architectural frame work of the RYU controller and converting the design into a Python code.

\section{The Design Objectives}

The finished application should be compatible with the RYU controller and be able to handle packets in real time. The timing diagram\ref{fig:Radius-Timing} shows how the RADIUS control flow should happen in the application for authentication.

\subsection{RADIUS Procedure} \label{RADIUS_Procedure}

	\caption {RADIUS Authentication Procedure - Timing Diagram }
	\label{fig:Radius-Timing}
	\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The mobile client first initiates a radius authentication request with the access point.
	\item The packet is verified and authenticated by the RADIUS request and response messages.
	\item If the authentication is a success, the connection is setup with the access point with WPA2 enterprise keying.
	\item Once the client is authenticated, it makes a DHCP request with the access point.   
	
\end{enumerate}
The flowchart \ref{fig:RYU-Flowchart} shows the authentication procedure of the RADIUS server. It also shows the step by step actions that take place in authenticating a client.

	\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}
\subsection{RYU Control Procedure} \label{RYU Control Procedure}
The timing diagram of RYU \ref{fig:RYU-Timing} shows how the RYU is supposed to listen to the MAC address of the client and parse the packet to assign the destination port id for the client.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{RYU-Timing}
	\caption {RYU Control Procedure - Timing Diagram }
	\label{fig:RYU-Timing}
	\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

When the client initiates a DHCP request (Broadcast packet) to the access point, the RYU controller listens to the source and destination MAC address and checks if it already exists in the local table and if not then it checks in the MySQL DB if it exists. At the same time, it learns the MAC address for the source port and stores it in its local table. If the source MAC address exists in the DB but the destination address is a broadcast address, then the out port id is retrieved but ignored by the RYU. The RYU controller applies the default flooding implementation to those packets and floods them to all ports in the switch. The DHCP request from the mobile client is now received by the DHCP server and causes a unicast response.  The source MAC address of the response is again checked in the local RYU table and in the DB. If it exist in the MySQL DB, then the out port id is chosen from there. If it doesn't exist, it is chosen from the local table. In this case, the destination is only available in the local table, the RYU controller responds by setting the rule for this MAC address to be reached through this out port id. The out port id is learned from the source MAC address during the initial DHCP discovery sent by the Mobile client. Finally, the Mobile client receives the DHCP response with an IP address.

In the second scenario after successful authentication of the Mobile client, it makes a unicast request to the IIS server. The RYU controller checks for the source and destination MAC in its local table and in the DB. The DB returns the out port id to the RYU controller. The source MAC address was learned during the authentication, and is now retrieved from the database. The out port set in the database overwrites the out port that might be known in the local table. The RYU controller sets this out port to the source MAC address of the Mobile client in the OVS table. The access point now forwards all the packets coming from the Mobile client through the out port set by the RYU which leads to the IIS server.

%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item When the client initiates a DHCP request to the access point, the RYU controller listens to the clients MAC address and checks if it exists in the OVS flow table.
%	\item If it exists, apply the corresponding rule associated with the MAC. If it doesnâ€™t exist, check the MAC in the MySQL database.
%	\item In the first scenario, if the MAC address exists in the MySQL DB, get the port ID associated with the MAC.
%	\item Apply this out port id from the database to the MAC address and add the flow to the OVS flow table and complete the DHCP response.
%	\item In the second scenario, if the MAC address does not exist in MySQL DB, add the MAC to the table and set the port id to flood mode in the OVS flow table in the access point.
%	\item Complete the DHCP response by providing an IP to the client.
%	
%\end{enumerate}
The flowchart  \ref{fig:RYU-Flowchart} will provide an overview of the control flow that would take place in the RYU controller and the OVS. Starting from learning the MAC address to assigning the out port id to the MAC.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{RYU-Flowchart}
	\caption {RYU Control Procedure - Flowchart}
	\label{fig:RYU-Flowchart}
	\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

From the flowchart \ref{fig:RYU-Flowchart}, it is clear that the initial DHCP request made by the mobile client to the AP is flooded to all ports in the AP. The RYU controller captures this request and retrieves the MAC address of the client. The packet passes through two conditions, the first condition is to check whether the client MAC address is already in the table. If the MAC address exists, then the packet passes to the second condition. The second condition is where the MAC address is checked if it is associated to a corresponding out port ID.  In case, the out port ID is found. Then the packet is converted to a unicast with the assigned out port through which all the packets coming from the client will pass through to its destination in future. If the packet fails in the first condition, then the packet is dropped else if it fails in the second condition. The packet is flooded to all the ports in the OVS and the MAC address is learnt to avoid flooding in future.

Due to the current OpenFlow version (v1.3) used by the OVS, it is limited to assigning only one out port per user instead of multiple ports. This feature will be available in future versions of OpenFlow when supported by OVS.

\section{RYU Manager Process \cite{RYU_app_process}} \label{RYU_Manager_Process}
 For designing the application, the RYU manager process is considered. This is explained using the diagram \ref{fig:RYU-Event-Process}.
 \begin{figure}
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{RYU-event-process}
 	\caption {RYU Manager Event Process \cite{RYU_event_process_diag}}
 	\label{fig:RYU-Event-Process}
 	\vspace{-10pt}
 \end{figure}
To build the application in python, the following classes are mainly used. \textit{Application} is the user logic instructions that tells how the application should behave. It is a class that inherits the \textit{ryu.base.app\_manager.RyuApp}. \textit{Events} are class objects that are used in communication between applications. It inherits the class \textit{ryu.controller.event.EventBase}. \textit{Event queues} are the single queues that each application has for receiving events. 

RYU uses \textit{eventlets} to run in a multi-threaded environment. These threads are non-preemptive. \textit{Event Loops} are threads that are created for each application. When there is an event in the queue, this loop will load the event and call the corresponding handler.  \textit{Event handlers} are user defined handlers designed to handle when a specific type of event occurs. They reside in the event loop of an application. Event handlers can be defined by decorating the application class method with the \textit{ryu.controller.handler.set\_ev\_cls} decorator.

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Application is the user logic that explains how the application should behave. It is a class that inherits the \textit{ryu.base.app\_manager.RyuApp}.

%	
%\end{itemize}

\section{Python Coding}\label{Python_code}
The code is built using an existing RYU MAC learning switch and is modified for user segregation. Initially, the code was designed to listen to the packets that are passing through the OVS and learn the MAC address of the devices that are connected to the switch and install the flow in the OVS flow table if both the out\_port and the destination are the same. This thesis adds additional functionality to this application that is discussed in this section. 

The \textit{set\_ev\_class} sets the event handler for the packet-in event and passing it on to the method \textit{ \_packet\_in\_handler} to parse the incoming packets. The packets are parsed by the method and details about the packets are extracted such as the in-port, datapath, payload etc.

\begin{lstlisting} [language=Python]
	@set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
	def _packet_in_handler(self, ev):
		# If you hit this you might want to increase
		# the "miss_send_length" of your switch
		if ev.msg.msg_len < ev.msg.total_len:
			self.logger.debug("packet truncated: only %s of %s bytes", ev.msg.msg_len, ev.msg.total_len)
		msg = ev.msg
		datapath = msg.datapath
		ofproto = datapath.ofproto
		parser = datapath.ofproto_parser
		in_port = msg.match['in_port']
		pkt = packet.Packet(msg.data)
		eth = pkt.get_protocols(ethernet.ethernet)[0]
		udp_payload = pkt.get_protocols(udp.udp)
\end{lstlisting}

Once the source and destination MAC address is retrieved from the packet, the source MAC address is then checked in the MySQL DB as shown in the code snippet below. The statement \textit{cursor.execute} also retrieves the port id from the database for the corresponding MAC if it is found as shown in the code snippet below.

\begin{lstlisting} [language=Python]
	#creating a mysql connection to database
		
	connection = MySQLdb.connect(host = "192.168.1.169", user = "freerad", passwd = "pass", db = "radius")
	cursor = connection.cursor ()
	cursor.execute ("SELECT portid FROM radcheck WHERE username IN (SELECT user FROM radpostauth WHERE CallingStationId = %s AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) from radpostauth) )", src)
	outport_for_src = cursor.fetchone ()	
	cursor.close()
	connection.close ()
	# Mysql verification end
\end{lstlisting}

In this step, the incoming port id (\textit{in\_port}) is stored in the \textit{self.mac\_to\_port} array. The first \textit{if} condition then checks if the destination MAC address is in the array \textit{self.mac\_to\_port}, if it exists then the second condition checks if the out port retrieved from the database is not empty or null. Then the third condition checks if the retrieved out port id from the database is the same as the one retrieved from the packet coming from the client, then the port id in the array \textit{self.mac\_to\_port} is assigned to the \textit{out\_port} variable.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	    self.mac_to_port[dpid][src] = in_port
if dst in self.mac_to_port[dpid]:
	test = self.mac_to_port[dpid][dst]
	if outport_for_src != None and all(outport_for_src):
	    if int(outport_for_src[0]) == self.mac_to_port[dpid][dst]:
	    	out_port = self.mac_to_port[dpid][dst]
	    else:	
	    	return
    else:
	    #except (TypeError,UnboundLocalError):		
	    out_port = self.mac_to_port[dpid][dst]			
\end{lstlisting}

The flowing code snipped explains the scenario when there is no out-port id is mentioned in the database for the corresponding MAC address. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
	if outport_for_src != None and all(outport_for_src):
		out_port = int(outport_for_src[0])
	else:
	#except (TypeError,UnboundLocalError):
	
		out_port = ofproto.OFPP_FLOOD
	actions = [parser.OFPActionOutput(out_port)]
\end{lstlisting}

The variable \textit{out\_port} is assigned a FLOOD mode and the class \textit{parser.OFPActionOutput} is called to parse the \textit{out\_port} mode set in the previous conditions. 

A new flow is then assigned to the OVS switch with the obtained \textit{out\_port} conditions. The code snipped below shows the usual procedure to add the flow by using \textit{add\_flow} method providing values such as datapath, match conditions, and actions like setting the out port and buffer id if it exists. The packet is updated with the new information and sent out using the \textit{send\_msg} method that sends it to the OVS switch and a new flow entry is created in the OVS flow table.

\begin{lstlisting} [language=Python]
# install a flow to avoid packet_in next time
if out_port != ofproto.OFPP_FLOOD:
	match = parser.OFPMatch(in_port=in_port, eth_dst=dst)
	# verify if we have a valid buffer_id, if yes avoid to send both
	# flow_mod & packet_out
	if msg.buffer_id != ofproto.OFP_NO_BUFFER:
		self.add_flow(datapath, 1, match, actions, msg.buffer_id)
		return
	else:
		self.add_flow(datapath, 1, match, actions)
data = None
	if msg.buffer_id == ofproto.OFP_NO_BUFFER:
		data = msg.data
	out = parser.OFPPacketOut(datapath=datapath, buffer_id=msg.buffer_id, in_port=in_port, actions=actions, data=data)
	datapath.send_msg(out)
\end{lstlisting}
