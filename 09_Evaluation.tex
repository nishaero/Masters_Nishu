\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:Evaluation}
To evaluate whether the developed application works as intended, it is tested against the testbed setup as shown in this figure below. This chapter also discusses the performance of the RYU controller and Open vSwitch against the application’s performance.

\section{Testbed Description}
The image \ref{fig:test-layout} shows how the environment for testing is set up. Each section is explained below in detail.

The Mobile Client is a Samsung Nexus Android phone and the second device used is also an Android device capable of associating with a network via 802.1x. The access point is a TP-Link WDR4300 WLAN router capable of hosting multiple SSIDs. 

The physical switch of the access point is shown separately for a better view. The router consists of five Ethernet ports including one WAN port. The WAN port is configured to work as a LAN access port for management access from the Linux PC. The interfaces eth0.2, wlan0 and wlan1 are connected using the OpenWrt \textit{br-wifi} bridge. The port eth0.2 is connected to eth0.3 using a physical loop cable since adding a WiFi port to Open vSwitch is not supported. It is also not possible to connect a Linux bridge to Open vSwitch internally.

The bridge managed by Open vSwitch consist of the ports eth0.3, eth0.4 and eth0.5 which includes a DHCP server that provides a separate 192.168.3.0/24 network and gateway for all the devices connect to these ports. The ports eth0.4 and eth0.5 are connected to an IIS server running on a Windows 7 and Windows 10 operating systems respectively on two separate Laptops. Each of these server machines is connected to the OVS managed ports on the network 192.168.3.0/24, the Windows 7 machine is connected using 192.168.3.126 and the Windows 10 with 192.168.3.136.

The Linux PC on the other hand contains three physical network interface cards numbered in order from eth1 to eth3. It runs Edubuntu, a flavor of Ubuntu designed for educational use. The port eth1 is connected to the internet and the port eth3 is connected to the router which is associated with an IP 192.168.1.207. The PC also hosts a VirtualBox Ubuntu VM running Freeradius, the virtual network adapter is bridged with eth3 port in the PC and has the IP 192.168.1.169. The application MySQL and RYU controller reside on the PC and are associated to the PC’s IP.

\subsection{IIS Setup on Windows}
The following steps explain how to enable IIS server and host a test website associated with the machines IP that can be accessed from the mobile client.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To enable IIS server, Start -> Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Add Features on or off (on the left pane in the window). See figure \ref{fig:enable_iis} below.
	\item This will enable a pop-up menu with several options to enable or disable. In the menu, choose the Internet Information Services and also enable the sub-options.
	\item Once the installation is complete and after a reboot, the IIS application can be opened from the programs option in Windows or a simple windows search will also show the application.
	\item In the IIS window, as shown in figure \ref{fig:iis-www}, the server is enabled and running by default, it can be checked by typing localhost in a browser.
	\item The hosted site is in the directory C:/inetpub/wwroot/, iisstart.htm is the default page that shows when accessed from the browser. This is enough for this project to show if the mobile clients can access these sites.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Associating Two Mobile Clients to Access Point}
To test the handling capability of the user segregation application, two mobile clients are used as mentioned previously. There are two user ids (test and radius) that are predefined in the MySQL \gls{DB} which are associated to two out port ids. The users should only be logged in once after the RYU controller is started for the user segregation application to associate the users to it's out ports. If a user tries to login before the RYU controller is started, the OVS by default drops all the packets because of the failsafe mode set in the switch. The users ‘test’ and ‘radius’ are logged in via the OpenWrt SSID as seen in figure \ref{fig:two-ssid}.
\section{RYU Controller Performance}
The performance of RYU is discussed in the following steps, starting from running the controller to the response time of handling the associated mobile clients.

The RYU controller is initialized and started using the command \textit{ryu-manager --verbose usr\_seg.py > /tmp/log 2>\&1}, the verbose output can be viewed in real time by tailing the output from the logfile using the command \textit{tail -f /tmp/log} in a separate terminal. The detailed verbose output of RYU can be accessed in the appendix named \nameref{app:ch:logs}.
 
In the OpenWrt shell, the OVS is checked if the controller is active by issuing the command in the shell terminal \textit{ovs-vsctl show}, if it shows ‘connection is true’ then the controller has access to the OVS switch. The flow table shows the current data path that is stored for each connected device and can be viewed by using the command \textit{ovs-dpctl show}, this will show the ports and its internal port id’s starting from 1 to 3 for physical ports eth0.3 to eth0.5.

From the testbed layout, it can be seen that the initial RADIUS requests are made by the hostapd through the 192.168.1.1/24 network. Once the authentication is complete, the mobile client initiates a DHCP request that is broadcast to all the ports on the switch, the broadcast packet is received by the DHCP only after the RYU verifies the MAC address and floods the packets to all ports on the OVS. The DHCP then makes a unicast response to the OVS where it is captured by the RYU user segregation application. The application then instructs the OVS to associate the user client to the out port id from the MySQL DB. This can be verified in the data path that is stored in the OVS flow-table using the command as before \textit{ovs-dpctl dump-flows}. From the output, the out port assigned for the client's MAC address can be seen as \textit{actions:4}.

The RYU verbose log also contains the information when the user segregation application initiates the instruction to change the flow for the client. The log is documented in the appendix which can be accessed here \nameref{app:sec:RYUlogtrace}. It can also be verified from this figure \ref{fig:ping_test} that the client cannot access the second server \textit{192.168.3.126} when it is only allowed to connect to the server \textit{192.168.3.136} passing through the port eth0.4 as shown in figure \ref{fig:test-layout}.

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item  The RYU controller is initialized and started using the command \textit{ryu-manager --verbose usr\_seg.py > /tmp/log 2>\&1}, the verbose output can be viewed in real time by tailing the output from the logfile using the command \textit{tail -f /tmp/log} in a separate terminal. The detailed verbose output of RYU can be accessed in the appendix named \nameref{app:ch:logs}.
%	\item In the OpenWrt shell, the OVS is checked if the controller is active by issuing a command in the shell terminal \textit{ovs-vsctl show}, if it shows ‘connection is true’ then the controller as access to the OVS switch.
%	\item Now, the flow table can be viewed by using the command \textit{ovs-dpctl show}, this will show the ports and its internal port id’s starting from 1 to 3 for physical ports Eth0.3 to Eth0.5.
%	\item From the testbed layout, it can be seen that the initial RADIUS requests are made by the hostapd thru the 192.168.1.1 network. 
%	\item Once the authentication is complete, the mobile client initiates a DHCP request which is captured by the RYU user segregation application. The application then instructs the OVS to associate the user client to the out port id from the MySQL DB. 
%	\item Meanwhile, the whole flow table can be seen in the OpenWrt shell using the command ovs-dpctl show. In the output the outport assigned to the client MAC address can be seen.
%	\item In the RYU verbose log file, the applications instructions to change the flow can also be seen for the MAC address.
%	\item From the tests, it can be concluded that the users are properly associated to their out ports and can access the corresponding test IIS server machines and that too all these happens without any delay or latency for association.
%	
%\end{itemize}
\section{Open vSwitch performance}
The performance of the Open vSwitch is tested during various load scenarios using tools such as Iperfv3 and ping times. The steps to execute the tests and also analyzing the results are discussed in detail below.

Iperf is a testing tool that provides simulated loads for testing device performance in a network. The tool can be configured to generate traffic of varying sizes. It also provides a lot of customizations for each test scenarios. The man-page for Iperf shows all the options that can be used with the tool. For this project, the default settings are used. The Iperf server is running on the IIS server and the mobile client, the Iperf client was run on both IIS server machines.

The two scenarios for testing considered here are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scenario 1: Without OVS or OpenWrt to test the standard switch capacity as seen in figure \ref{fig:test_scenario_1}. 
	\item Scenario 2: With RYU and Open vSwitch running as seen in figure \ref{fig:test_scenario_2}.
\end{itemize}

Ping tests were also made keeping the same scenarios as above. The results of the Iperf tests were plotted as a graph for a better analysis and each test was made several times and graphs are plotted based on the average data obtained from the tests.

\subsection{Iperf result comparison}\label{sec:Iperf_result}
The graphs \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_no_ovs} \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_with_ovs} show the results of the Iperf test between the IIS server machines with and without the RYU and OVS running.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[Bandwidth throughput without OVS (Standard Switch)]{\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{Bandwidth-without-ryu-server-server}\label{fig:bandwidth_server_server_no_ovs}}
	\hfill
	\subfloat[Bandwidth with OVS]{\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{Bandwidth-with-ryu-server-server}\label{fig:bandwidth_server_server_with_ovs}}
	\caption{Iperf Throughput between two IIS servers}
\end{figure}

The figures \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_no_ovs} \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_with_ovs} represent the average throughput attained by the OVS switch when tested between the two servers as shown in the layout \ref{fig:test-layout}.

From the comparison, it is evident that there is a significant drop in the throughput when the OVS is running on the access point. Each ethernet port on the access point have a maximum bandwidth of 1Gbps, this is maintained when there is no OVS running on the access point. The values from the figure \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_no_ovs} are shown be consistent with the maximum capacity hovering around 900Mbps. 

Whereas in the second figure \ref{fig:bandwidth_server_server_with_ovs}, its clearly visible that the maximum achieved throughput is only available to be around 600Mbps and the waves in the graph represent the inconsistency to maintain it's target bandwidth. It can be concluded from this test that, running the OVS on the access point does impact the performance and bandwidth significantly but can be improved with a better processor and hardware, bringing the difference close to maximum capacity.  The achieved speeds in this access point are still big enough to handle large traffic but with some latency. The complete measurement data can be found as a table in the appendix \ref{sec:iperf_server_server}.

In the next scenario, the Iperf tool is run between the mobile client and the IIS server where the mobile client acts as the Iperf server. This test has a limitation, the wireless bandwidth is limited to the speeds of 802.11g and 802.11n which are mostly 54Mbps and around 100Mbps respectively. Though this test doesn’t accurately represent the capability and performance of the RYU and OVS, it does show the capacity of the access point to handle throughput on the wireless medium.

The two graphs \ref{fig:bandwidth_client_server_no_ovs} \ref{fig:bandwidth_client_server_with_ovs} shows the comparison of throughput bandwidth between the two scenarios.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[Bandwidth throughput without OVS (Standard Switch)]{\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{Bandwidth-without-ryu-server-client}\label{fig:bandwidth_client_server_no_ovs}}

	\caption{Iperf Throughput between Mobile client and IIS server}
\end{figure}

On the contrary, the results show a different behavior when compared to the previous test. The one with the OVS seems to perform better when compared to no OVS running in the access point. As can be seen from the first graph \ref{fig:bandwidth_client_server_no_ovs}, the bandwidth struggles to maintain an average speed of around 43Mbps which is the lower than the capacity of the wireless network, there are also small drops in the throughput which shows the impact of interference with neighboring channels, this is due to the limitation of the test environment. Whereas in the second graph \ref{fig:bandwidth_client_server_with_ovs}, the mobile device was able to achieve an average speed of around 48 Mbps which is slightly below the full capacity of the wireless bandwidth. This clearly shows that the OVS is optimized to handle wireless traffic.

The drops in throughput are due to the wireless congestion from various other networks in the tested environment. In spite of that, the achieved bandwidth is closer to the maximum capacity of the wireless network. From the above tests, it is evident that for a mobile device the impact of running OVS on the access point does not significantly reduce the throughput but it can deteriorate when there is congestion in the wireless medium. These drops can be seen throughout the tests, the complete measurement data can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:iperf_data_mob_server}.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item The graphs below show the results of the Iperf test between the IIS server machines with and without the RYU and OVS running.
%	\begin{figure}[H]

%		\caption{Iperf Throughput between two IIS servers}
%	\end{figure}
%	\item From the comparison one can see that there is a slight drop in the throughput when the RYU is running.
%	\item Each ethernet port on the access point have a maximum bandwidth of 1Gbps, this is maintained when there is no RYU running on the access point. The values from the figure is shown be consistent with the maximum capacity hovering around 900Mbps.
%	\item Whereas in the second figure, its clearly visible that the maximum achieved throughput is only available to be around 800Mbps and the waves in the graph represent the inconsistency to maintain target bandwidth.
%	\item It can be concluded from this test that, running the RYU and OVS on the access point does impact the performance and bandwidth though not significantly as these speeds are still large enough to handle large traffic but with some latency.
%	\item In the next scenario, the Iperf tool is run on the mobile client and the IIS server machines though this test has a limitation. The wireless bandwidth is limited to the speeds of 802.11g and 802.11n which are mostly 54Mbps and around 100Mbps respectively.
%	\item Though this test doesn’t accurately represent the capability of the RYU and OVS performance, it does show the capacity of the access point to handle through put on the wireless medium as well.
%	\item The following two figures shows the comparison of throughput bandwidth between the two scenarios.
%	\begin{figure}[H]
%		\centering
%		\subfloat[Bandwidth without RYU]{\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=10cm,keepaspectratio]{Bandwidth-without-ryu-server-client}\label{fig:bandwidth_client_server_no_ryu}}

%		\caption{Iperf Throughput between Mobile client and IIS servers}
%	\end{figure}
%	\item The results are similar to the once above, the one without RYU and OVS seem to perform better when compared to using a RYU and OVS in the access point. 
%	\item As can be seen from the first graph, the bandwidth slowly starts to rise within the first 5 seconds to a maximum speed of 60Mbps which is the capacity of the wireless network. Whereas in the second graph, the mobile device was only able to achieve a maximum speed of around 35 Mbps which is far below the full capacity of the wireless bandwidth and it takes more than 10 seconds to actually achieve its maximum capacity. 
%	\item The initial dips are due to the wireless congestion from various other networks in the tested environment. In spite of that, the achieved bandwidth is still below the maximum capacity of the wireless network.
%	\item From the above tests, it is evident that on a mobile device the impact of running RYU and OVS on the access point is more significant and can deteriorate when there is congestion in the wireless medium.
%	\item On the whole, the user segregation application performs as designed and the throughput is not impacted drastically on the physical ports but the same cannot be said with the wireless network.
%	
%\end{itemize}
\subsection{Ping tests}
Ping tests provide an insight into the latency introduced due to various other activities performed by the Operating Systems and by the controller when a device gets connected to the network, from the first ARP to subsequent pings.

The tests were executed in two methods using the ping command, one with a fixed time\footnote{1 packet per second} interval and the other is by flooding. They were performed in the same scenarios used for the previous tests.

The results of the first test with fixed time interval are shown below.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Ping Test Without OVS }, label={pingtest_no_ovs}]
--- 192.168.1.126 ping statistics ---
100 packets transmitted, 100 received, 0% packet loss, time 101375ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.184/0.262/0.526/0.056 ms
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Ping Test With OVS}, label={pingtest_ovs}]
--- 192.168.3.126 ping statistics ---
100 packets transmitted, 100 received, 0% packet loss, time 101348ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.289/0.617/28.897/2.842 ms
\end{lstlisting}
From the result, it can be noticed that the average time is around 0.262 milliseconds and the maximum time is 0.526 when there is no OVS installed, this is an acceptable result as the performance of the switch. When the OVS is running, the average is around 0.617 milliseconds and the maximum is 28.897 milliseconds. It can be inferred that there is a higher latency when the OVS is running on the switch and that the OVS does impact the performance of the access point in this regard.

The tests were conducted each time by deleting the ARP cache in the Linux system and the flow-table in the OVS. There is an initial delay during the first ping and the subsequent pings. In case of a standard switch, the delay is very small as seen in the ping result below. This is due to the ARP request that takes place in the beginning of the test. From the ping results below, it can be noted that, the one with the OVS running has a larger delay during the initial ping. This latency is because the first ARP request also goes through the RYU controller, thereby causing a delay until the packets are sent to the destination. The subsequent requests will not have much delay because the source machine knows where the destination is. The complete ping results can be found the appendix \nameref{app:ch:Ping_results}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Initial Ping result without OVS },label={lst:initial_ping_no_ovs}]

\end{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{ping-timing}
	\caption {ARP and Ping timing sequence}
	\label{fig:arp_ping_timing}
	\vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

The timing diagram \ref{fig:arp_ping_timing} for ARP and Ping shows how each incoming ARP and Ping requests are processed. For each ARP broadcast from PC1, the RYU receives and verifies the packet headers against the MySQL DB. It then floods the broadcast packet to all ports. The PC2 responds to this ARP request with a unicast response and again the packet goes through the OVS and gets verified by the RYU controller and forwarded back to PC1 using the out port from the learned MAC. This procedure takes place for the Ping request as well. Though it can be considered that the application is inefficient, it was done to check the delay introduced for each packet when it passes through the RYU controller. In real world, this latency will not be created since the OVS uses an ARP responder table \cite{man_ofctl} that optimizes ARP messages passing through the OVS causing almost no delay in forwarding these requests. 

Even the latency introduced for each packet passing through the RYU controller and querying the MySQL database every time is very negligible (under 0.01 ms) in our case. This might introduce an additional delay if the MySQL database resides on a separate server, but in this case it is on the same machine as the RYU controller. 


Though this latency from the initial ping as shown in the listing \ref{lst:initial_ping_ovs} will not be a major concern for a few devices but in a large network, this reduction in latency can impact greatly when many number of devices are connected to the access point bringing down the efficiency of the network. The results are similar when tested by ping flood. The results are shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Ping Flood Without OVS}, label={pingflood_no_ovs}]
--- 192.168.1.126 ping statistics ---
100000 packets transmitted, 100000 received, 0% packet loss, time 18625ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.061/0.180/51.981/0.450 ms, pipe 4, ipg/ewma 0.186/0.134 ms
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Ping Flood With OVS}, label={pingflood_ovs}]
--- 192.168.3.126 ping statistics ---
100000 packets transmitted, 100000 received, 0% packet loss, time 21643ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.111/0.205/48.572/0.526 ms, pipe 4, ipg/ewma 0.216/0.196 ms
\end{lstlisting}

The average round trip time for flood statistics in both the scenarios show that running the OVS only creates a 0.1 millisecond delay but overall for transmitting 100000 packets, it took around 3000 milliseconds more. The results are conclusive as with the previous test and demonstrates the significant increase in latency in a high traffic environment.
